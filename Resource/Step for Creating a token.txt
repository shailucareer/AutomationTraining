Hello Team,
I had forgot to tell you about the GIT token in the demo
For this, I am sharing the step by which you can generate your token

a token will be your password when you want to commit code from eclipse to git.

Step for Creating a token
1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
2. In the left sidebar, click  Developer settings.
3. In the left sidebar, click Personal access tokens.
4. Personal access tokens
5. Click Generate new token.
6. Generate a new token button
7. Give your token a descriptive name.
8. Token description field (required field)
9. To give your token an expiration, select the Expiration drop-down menu, then click a default or use the calendar picker.
10. Select the scope,  you'd like to grant this token. select repo.
11. Finally Click Generate token.

Copy this generated token in notepad or anywhere
When you will commit you code to GIT
eclipse will ask credential for the same

so, you need to enter your User name here and Instead of password enter your generated TOKEN

and select the Secure Checked box, if you checked this checked box, Eclipse will not ask about the credentials from the next time
